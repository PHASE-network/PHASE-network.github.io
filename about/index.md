PHASE is an open community working on advanced hadronic scattering and decay amplitudes.
It has been announced to the hadron physics community on February 10th, 2017.
The PHASE proposal is available at [authorea](https://goo.gl/5o36g5) and is currently
und revision by the community.


For general discussions of projects and ideas or to find collaborators, please visit the [HadronicDiscussions](https://github.com/PHASE-network/HadronicDiscussions).
