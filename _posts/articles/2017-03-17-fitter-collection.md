There are many amplitude analysis software packages being developed in the
various experimental groups. The [PHASE network](https://github.com/PHASE-network)
provides a collection of freely available fitters.

* [PyPWA](https://github.com/PHASE-network/PyPWA) - a partial-wave analysis framework with a python API developed at Jefferson Lab
* [GooFit](https://github.com/PHASE-network/GooFit) - an amplitude analysis fitter for GPUs
* [RapidFit](https://github.com/PHASE-network/RapidFit) - a log-likelihood fitter used at LHCb for studies of CP violation and spectroscopy in B decays.
* [CFit](https://github.com/PHASE-network/cfit) - a basic fitter in plain C++
* [ROOTPWA](https://github.com/PHASE-network/ROOTPWA) - a complete partial-wave analysis framework
for scattering and decay experiments. Developed at COMPASS
* [Mint2](https://github.com/PHASE-network/Mint2) an amplitude fitter based on qft++.
Developed for CLEO and LHCb
