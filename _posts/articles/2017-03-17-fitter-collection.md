There are many amplitude analysis software packages being developed in the
various experimental groups. The [PHASE network](https://github.com/PHASE-network)
provides a collection of freely available fitters.

* [PyPWA](https://github.com/PHASE-network/PyPWA) - a partialwave analysis framework with a python API developed at Jefferson Lab
* [GooFit](https://github.com/PHASE-network/GooFit) - an amplitude analysis fitter for GPUs
* [RapidFit](https://github.com/PHASE-network/RapidFit) - a log-likelihood fitter used at LHCb for studies of CP violation and spectroscopy in B decays.

If you want your software to be listed on these pages please open a new issue on
the [Hadronic Discussions](https://github.com/PHASE-network/HadronicDiscussions/issues).
Your contribution will be very welcome!
