PHASE is an open community working on advanced hadronic scattering and decay amplitudes.
It has been announced to the hadron physics community on February 10th, 2017.
The proposal is available at [authorea](https://goo.gl/5o36g5).

For general discussions of projects and ideas or to find collaborators, please visit the [HadronicDiscussions](https://github.com/PHASE-network/HadronicDiscussions).

We are happy that youare here and look forward to your contributions.

Kind regards,
Sebastian.
