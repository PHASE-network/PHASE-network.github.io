PHASE is an open community working on advanced hadronic scattering and decay amplitudes.
It provides a platform for theorists and experimentalists to exchange ideas, work on
shared projects and create advanced amplitude analysis tools. Please have a look at the
software projects collected in our github organisation <https://github.com/PHASE-network>.

The project has been announced to the hadron physics community on February 10th, 2017.
The proposal is available at [authorea](https://goo.gl/5o36g5) and is currently
under revision.

For general discussions of projects and ideas or to find collaborators, please visit the [HadronicDiscussions](https://github.com/PHASE-network/HadronicDiscussions).

We are happy that you are here and look forward to your contributions.

Kind regards,
Sebastian.
